Objective
My current objective is to provide any workspace with the experience and skills that I have acquired through school and other forms of learning. I want to be able to provide a company/industry with the skills, time and work needed to help them succeed in all spectrums that I can be a part of.
Experience

ASSOCIATE | PANDA EXPRESS | 8/2015 – 7/2017
·	In Panda Express, I worked three positions where I either served the food, handled the register, or cooked and cleaned in the back. Each customer had to be treated equally and with the same amount of energy to provide a satisfying visit with quality products.

SECURITY | PARKING AND TRANSPORTATION | 2/2018 – 5/2018
·	I had to control the traffic flow within the campus to ensure the safety of the students, without preventing access to public transportation and other authorized vehicles. In this job, I worked alone where I had to manage a gate that allowed access to the campus of University of Colorado, Boulder.

RETAIL AND CUSTOMER SATISFACTION | AUTOZONE | 6/2018 – 7/2018
·	At AutoZone, I was trained to make sure the customer left the store with everything needed to complete the job at hand. Most of the job work dealt with customer service and serving the customer and their needs. This was always met with a smile. Other duties on the job were to replace batteries for eligible vehicles as well as light bulbs and windshield wipers.

PEER ADVISOR | FINANCIAL AID AND SCHOLARSHIP’S OFFICE, UNIVERSITY OF COLORADO, DENVER | 10/2018 – 12/2018
·	In the Financial Aid Office, I was trained to know all the functions of financial aid within the University. This knowledge was applied in a phone bank where I would answer calls directed to the office with the ability to answer all questions concerning financial aid. The job required customer service as in the phone bank I had to work with many unsatisfied students and parents who were having troubles with financial aid.

SALES ADVISOR | 24 HOUR FITNESS | 12/2018 
·	As a Sales Advisor at 24 Hour Fitness, my responsibility to the club was to address every guest that walks in the doors, answer all questions and concerns they have, provide them with all details that entail to a gym membership at 24 Hour Fitness as well as provide them with the help to get them signed up if wanted. This job requires for me to speak to a lot of people may it be over phone or in person, but a skill that I have acquired here is to be able to listen and attend to the needs and wants of a guest through conversation. I also work with computers making me proficient in the programs in place for my job. 

INSTRUCTOR | CODING WITH KIDS | 12/2018 
·	With Coding with Kids, the primary objective for my job was to educate children on software development and all branches that software development may come into contact with. I had to teach kids with classroom sizes ranging from 8 to 16 students from ages 6 to 10. I taught students through a variety of programs, such as Scratch and Animatron. Scratch was a program where kids learned basic code using premade coding blocks that kids must patch together to create a game. Students were able to learn basic if-else statements along with variables scopes.  Animatron was a animation creator program that allowed students to create animations frame by frame using premade characters or characters made from scratch. With more advanced students, I was able to stem away from the lesson plan and teach languages, such as HTML and CSS.

Skills & Abilities
TEAM PLAYER
·	I played high school lacrosse for all four years of high school where working as a team was a very essential skill that I had to learn as I had to be able to make the others around me better as they did the same for me. I currently the Offensive Coach of Rangeview High School trying to move the program forward with the current coaching staff.

SALES
·	Worked for AutoZone as well as Panda Express as sales were the main objective. The focus was customer service where we had to make sure the customer was leaving the store with what they wanted and with the experience they were happy with. Using that mindset, I was able to provide plenty of sales for both companies selling food and auto parts.

COMMUNICATION
·	Playing in team sports and working in places, such as, AutoZone and Panda Express I had to communicate with people. Not only did I have to communicate, but I also had to present who I really was to appeal to the teammate or customer which seemed to have worked for most of them with my upbeat and joyful attitude. Also, in high school I took a Public Speaking class where we learned how to properly present to a big group of people as professional as can be.

LEADERSHIP
·	Playing Varsity lacrosse for four years I knew from the beginning that I wanted to be the team captain. So, every year I worked hard not only on myself but with others to prove to other and to myself that I could lead this team. Fortunately, I was chosen by the team my senior year to be the captain and provided the team with the most points and most wins in the regular season.
